This is really just a re-release of the old URI::URL module as
distributed in libwww-perl-5.36.  This code is really depreciated. It
is only made available for those who have really want the old (and now
broken) RFC 1808 behaviour.

The new URI.pm package implements the new RFC 2396 behaviour and
contain a URI::URL interface emulation module for old code.  I
recommend that new code is written based on the new URI.pm interface.

The next libwww-perl release will not include any URI modules and will
be adjusted to use URI.pm instead of URI::URL.
